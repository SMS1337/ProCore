# ProCore Client
ProCore (short for Professional Core) is a complete replacement to the Core Graphical User Interface on ROBLOX's client + Studio.

Meant to be more lightweight, easier to customize, and open to more developers.

# Development
This is a open-source project! Help us develop!
I will be taking any non-malicious pull requests.

# Installation
If you want to use the chat, there is now a package on ROBLOX for it: http://www.roblox.com/ProChat-1-0-0-Panther-item?id=234218451


If you want to use something else, you'll have to compile it yoursel with the guide below.

#Compile files
A lot of files in the repository is labeled "xml". This is because you need to compile them.


To compile a file, you need to download the XML source file, and change the file extension from "XML" to "RBXMX". From there you can go to Studio > Model tab > the icon with an arrow going down labeled "Model".


You choose the file, and ta da! you have the compiled file!
